## Introduction
This pipeline is designed for using HiC sequencing data with nanopore assemblies attempting fetching relatively chromosomal level assemblies. Most of ideas are refered to [ALLHiC Github](https://github.com/tangerzhang/ALLHiC/wiki).

The entire workflow for nanopore assembly, NGS data polishment, and HiC chromatin signal incorpration are shown below:
![Main Workflow](https://github.com/gudusanjiao/HiCassembly/blob/main/miscellaneous/Workflow.png "Workflow")
Steps below are a pipeline started from raw nanopore aseembly to reach chromosomal level assembly (Yellow box above). It works fine with *Salix nigra* now. There have been issues with *Salix exigua* which we are still working on it. 

To prepare the softwares in this pipeline, you need to install [ALLHiC](https://github.com/tangerzhang/ALLHiC/wiki), [samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/), [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [bwa](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html).

## Step 1: Index raw nanopore assembly
This step take raw nanopore aseembly fasta file as input to create index file for both alignment and BAM file operations.
> When we call "raw assembly" here, we refer to assembly using nanopore reads assembled by chosen aseemblers, and then polished by NextPolish using NGS read. Noted here, the "raw assembly" is not 'raw', it is after 4 rounds of polishing. This term will be use for all following steps unless special mentions.

If your genome assembly is already indexed previously due to other analyzing process, you may skip this step.

`SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta` file is the raw assembly of *Salix nigra* stored under `./ref/`
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_index
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/01/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/01/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 1
#$ -P quanah

bwa index -a bwtsw ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta  
samtools faidx ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta
```
Output files are `.bwt`, `.pac`, `.ann`, `.amb` files.

## Step 2: Align HiC reads to raw nanopore assembly
HiC reads are generated by sequencing DNA segments that potentially binds by chromatins. This step we will map all the HiC reads to raw assembly. Since we have multiple HiC returned file, we need to do mapping for each file separately.

`./HiC` is where we stored our HiC reads.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_rawAlign
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/02/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/02/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 36
#$ -P quanah

bwa aln -t 36 ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta ./HiC/SN527M_39.77G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R1.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s1_R1.sai  
bwa aln -t 36 ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta ./HiC/SN527M_39.77G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R2.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s1_R2.sai
bwa sampe ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta \ 
          SN_HiC_s1_R1.sai \ 
          SN_HiC_s1_R2.sai \ 
          ./HiC/SN527M_39.77G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R1.fastq.gz \
          ./HiC/SN527M_39.77G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R2.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s1.sam

bwa aln -t 36 ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta ./HiC/SN527M_5.96G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R1.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s2_R1.sai
bwa aln -t 36 ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta ./HiC/SN527M_5.96G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R2.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s2_R2.sai
bwa sampe ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta \ 
          SN_HiC_s2_R1.sai SN_HiC_s2_R2.sai \ 
          ./HiC/SN527M_5.96G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R1.fastq.gz \ 
          ./HiC/SN527M_5.96G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R2.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s2.sam
```
This step takes several hours to finish. Output files are pair-end mapping `.sai` files and aligned read file `.sam`.

## Step 3: Filter alignment
This step will do 1) pre-filter reads without restriction enzyme sites 2) removing low-quality mapping hits 3) converting `.sam` file to `.bam` file.

`PreprocessSAMs.pl` requires a restriction enzyme name used during genome digestion before HiC sequencing. It is either MboI (N|GATC / CTAG|N) (the same as DpnII) or HindIII (A|AGCTT / TTCGA|A). Before processing this step, you need to check the enzyme using for digesting genome by asking the sequencing company. `PreprocessSAMs.pl` will produce `.pos_of_GATC.txt`, `.near_GATC.500.bed`, `.REduced.bam`, `.REduced.paired_only.bam`, and `.REduced.paired_only.flagstat` files. Use the name of `.REduced.paired_only.bam` as the input for `filterBAM_forHiC.pl`.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_filter
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/03/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/03/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 36
#$ -P quanah

PreprocessSAMs.pl SN_HiC_s1.sam SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta MBOI
filterBAM_forHiC.pl SN_HiC_s1.REduced.paired_only.bam SN_HiC_s1_clean.sam
samtools view -bt ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta.fai SN_HiC_s1_clean.sam > SN_HiC_s1_clean.bam

PreprocessSAMs.pl SN_HiC_s2.sam SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta MBOI
filterBAM_forHiC.pl SN_HiC_s2.REduced.paired_only.bam SN_HiC_s2_clean.sam
samtools view -bt /ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta.fai SN_HiC_s2_clean.sam > SN_HiC_s2_clean.bam
```
Output of this step are `_clean.bam` files.

## Step 4: Merge BAM files
This step merge filtered results from each read files into a single one.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_mergeBAM
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/04/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/04/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 6
#$ -P quanah

samtools merge SN_HiC.bam SN_HiC_s1_clean.bam SN_HiC_s2_clean.bam
```
Output of this step is a single `.bam` file. I named it `SN_HiC.bam` here.

## Step 5: Prune allelic links and weak signals (Optional. Only for polyploids)
**Skip step 5 and step 7 if you are working on diploid individuals.**

This is only for dealing with polyploids in assembly. Before we go to further steps, we need to prune the HiC signals generated by polyploidy level. There are two ways to mark the paralogs due to genome duplication (See [identify allelic contigs using annotation](https://github.com/tangerzhang/ALLHiC/wiki/ALLHiC:-identify-allelic-contigs) and [identify allelic contigs without annotation target genome](https://github.com/tangerzhang/ALLHiC/issues/16)). We used the second approach since we do not have the annotation for our target species but we have one for closed related species *Salix purpurea*. We used *Salix exigua* file as an example here since in our previous estimation of genome size, the male of our sampling in *Salix exigua* exhibits evidences for being a tetraploid.

We need to install gmap software for this step. Details are in [GMAP manual](http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/).

Making GMAP database:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N gmap_Spur2SE
#$ -q omni
#$ -pe sm 18
#$ -P quanah

gmap_build -D . -d DB ./ref/SE.finalpolish.fasta
gmap -D . -d DB -t 18 -f 2 -n 4 ./ref/Spurpurea_519_v5.1.cds.fa.gz > Spur2SE_gmap.gff3
```
Building gmap betweem *S. exigua* and *S. purpurea*:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N gmap_Spur2SE_gff
#$ -q omni
#$ -pe sm 18
#$ -P quanah

gmap -D . -d DB -t 18 -f 2 -n 4 ./ref/Spurpurea_519_v5.1.cds.fa > Spur2SE_gmap.gff3
```
Generate allelic table:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N alletic_table
#$ -q omni
#$ -pe sm 18
#$ -P quanah

mv Spur2SE_gmap.gff3 gmap.gff3
perl ~/software/ALLHiC/scripts/gmap2AlleleTable.pl gmap.gff3
```
perl script used here is located at `<path of ALLHiC>/scripts/`.

After fetching a `Allele.ctg.table` file from above processes, we can use `ALLHiC_prune` to remove redundant signals for our HiC assembly.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SE_allHiC_prune
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/05/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/05/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 36
#$ -P quanah

module load gnu/5.4.0

ALLHiC_prune -i ./gmap/Allele.ctg.table -b SE_HiC.bam -r ./ref/SE.finalpolish.fasta
```
(In progress)

## Step 6: Partition: Assign contigs into a pre-defined number of groups
This step runs for assign contigs into groups based on HiC signals. Parameter `-e` refers to restriction enzyme sites (See step 4). Parameter `-k` refers to pre-defined number of groups. In our case, as we know the linkage group number is 19 for willows, `-k` should be 19. However, I was too ambitious to expect the software would discriminate X and Y chromosomes for me. Thus, I put 20 for this parameter.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_partition
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/06/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/06/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 6
#$ -P quanah

module load gnu/5.4.0

ALLHiC_partition -b SN_HiC.bam -r ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta -e GATC -k 20
```
Output of this step are list of `.group` files. They are contigs included in each putative linkage groups.

## Step 7: Rescue: Assign unplaced contigs into partitioned clusters (Optional. Only for ployploids)
Using *Salix exigua* file as an example for the same reason as step 5.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SE_allHiC_rescue
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/07/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/07/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 36
#$ -P quanah

module load gnu/5.4.0

ALLHiC_rescue -r ./ref/SE.finalpolish.fasta -b SE_HiC.bam -c prunning.clusters.txt -i prunning.counts_GATC.txt
```
(In progress)

## Step 8: Extract grouping information
This small step is to extract grouping information from alignment files. `--RE` parameter is the same parameter as `-e` in Step 6 asking restriction enzyme site.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_extract
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/08/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/08/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 1
#$ -P quanah

module load gnu/5.4.0

allhic extract SN_HiC.bam SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta --RE GATC
```
Output of this step are `.clusters.txt`, `.counts_RE.txt`, `.clm`, `.distribution.txt`, and `.pairs.txt` files.

## Step 9: Optimize directions of contigs
This step will correct the directions of contigs in each putative linkage group based on HiC contacting signals. It takes `.clm` file as input and automaticly reads files from the same directory. These files record basic information of Hi-C links between two contigs, including potential ordering and orientation, number of supported reads and distance of paired-end reads. Loop times in code refer to `-k` parameter in Step 6. In `SN_HiC.counts_GATC.20g${K}`, the number "20" refers to the same parameter as well.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_optimize
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/09/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/09/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 6
#$ -P quanah

module load gnu/5.4.0

for K in {1..20}; do allhic optimize SN_HiC.counts_GATC.20g${K}.txt SN_HiC.clm; done
```
Output of this step are `.tour` files. Numbers equals to loop times.

## Step 10: Build FASTA file
This step builds up final FASTA file based on `.tour` file connecting contigs together. Make sure every files are in the same folder for software to read.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_build
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/10/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/10/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 6
#$ -P quanah

module load gnu/5.4.0

ALLHiC_build ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta
```
Output of this step is `groups.asm.fasta` and `groups.agp`. `groups.asm.fasta` is the final HiC result.

## Step 11: Plot chromatin contacting map
This step is for plotting chromatin contacting map to evaluate the quality of HiC assembly. The plot will only be performed on linkage groups we selected. All the raw contigs will be ignored in plotting.

Following scripts are used to generate a list of group names, parse it to python scripts to generate group length for plotting. Two python scripts [seqlength.py](https://github.com/gudusanjiao/HiCassembly/blob/main/miscellaneous/seqlength.py) and [pick_seq_list.py](https://github.com/gudusanjiao/HiCassembly/blob/main/miscellaneous/pick_seq_list.py) are offered in this repository. You can also have your own scripts to do this job. I am just offering my solutions here (I am bad at coding so these codes might be silly in some ways).
```bash
grep ">" groups.asm.fasta | head -20 > linkage_groups.list
python pick_seq_list.py -f groups.asm.fasta -l linkage_groups.list -o linkage_groups_only.fasta
python seqlength.py -f linkage_groups_only.fasta > linkage_groups_length.txt
```
Generate the chromatin contact matrix to evaluate genome scaffolding. Parameter `500k` here is the bin size. For our genome size equals to 400M, this is a reasonable settings. For larger genome size, bin size can be larger.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_plot
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/11/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/11/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 6
#$ -P quanah

module load gnu/5.4.0

ALLHiC_plot SN_HiC.bam groups.agp linkage_groups_length.txt 500k pdf
```
Output of this step are `.pdf` files of plotting results.
